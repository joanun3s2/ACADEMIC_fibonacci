# ACADEMIC_fibonacci
Academic program for solving the fibonacci sequence in C++(11).
It was given an original code which I have changed to corret the algorithm work.
This program was developed with the purpose of use *Debbuging* methods in C++(*linux terminal*).
Both *GDB* and *manual debbuging* and comparing both to understand which can be used in what momment.

On the ´/Documents´ directory you can find documentation about the requeried problem solution and an kind of *starting guid to* ***GDB*** such as the report of the found problems on the original code.
